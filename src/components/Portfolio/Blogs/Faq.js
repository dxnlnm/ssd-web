        The Super Space Defenders is an upcoming NFT Collection consisting on 8,888 cloned individuals with different personalities, political affinities and visuals. They’re mainly divided in two groups: The Elites and The Citizens. The Elites are a group of wealthy Families that govern the galaxy while the Citizens are the workforce of the galaxy, living under the Elite’s rules. But... where is the Rebellion?</p>

      <br />
        <p className="profile-description">
        The Aurora Capsules is a separate NFT Collection that has future utilities and its heavily attached to the Super Space Defenders collection. Commander Minerva Bellatrix stole 1,111 from the hands of the Yamamoto Family. Those capsules will be allocated to the most loyal and talented soldiers throughout special events. Each Capsule works as a mint pass that gives you access to purchase up to 3 Super Space Defenders… it’s up to you to hold the capsule, buy some others or sell them to the highest bidder.</p>

      <br />
        <p className="profile-description">
        We condemn wars in all means, and that includes gas wars. That's why we have chosen to do it through allowlist model for all 1,111 Aurora Capsules and also as a way to reward early followers/collectors. The model used for the 8,888 Super Space Defenders is still in works and will be announced in the future.</p>

        <h1 className="education-heading">THE ALLOWLIST</h1>
      <br />
        <p className="profile-description">
        We believe all of you deserve a fair chance to be able to win an allowlist spot for the Aurora Capsules Collection. That’s why we will host special events/contests on Discord & Twitter, and some Special Collabs/Partnerships. </p>
        <br />
        <p className="profile-description">We know how much effort/time is put into grinding contests: like being active on Discord and hosting invite contests. We don’t want people to make fake interactions just to earn some points or fill the Discord with bots to reach the highest ranks, that’s why we’ve decided to make different kind of contests based on skills (not only art) and the interest to contribute on the project. That doesn’t mean we won’t make any grinding contest… they’ll just have an interesting twist.</p>
