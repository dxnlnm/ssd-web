        The human species is only a memory in the history books. The solar system is now inhabited by the Aurora Sapiens, biological duplicates with synthetic additives from Subject #8,888 Aurora, the only human whose genetic code managed to be replicated.</p>
        <br />
        <p className="profile-description">
        In control of the system are THE ELITES, a group of noble families who control the technology to generate the duplicates and, therefore, Venus and Mars’ workforce as well as the destiny of the population spread in Jupiter’s satellites.

        <br />
        <p>Any questioning of the regime is forbidden. </p>
        <br />
        <p>Any insurgence act is severely repressed by the elites' special forces THE TITANIDES ARMY and their fearsome RETROMACHINES. </p>
        <br />
        <p>Among the citizens, nevertheless, voices of protest are already being heard. Led by commander Minerva Bellatrix, a group of REBELS has seized some RETROMACHINES and now they intend to overthrow the elites. Their slogans are shared in whispers in the mining camps of Anteros and Nereus. Their propaganda is distributed surreptitiously among Mars University's slam poetry workshops. The face of commander Bellatrix paints the alleys of the poorest districts in Ganymede. </p>
        <br />
        <p>Will the rebels be able to overthrow the elites?</p>
        <p>Will the citizens join their fight?</p>
        <p>Will this war be the end of the new reigning species of the solar system...?</p>
